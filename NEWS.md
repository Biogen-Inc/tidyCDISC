# tidyCDISC 0.1.0 (CRAN Release)
* cleaning up `devtools::check()` & preparing for CRAN release.

* unfortunately, had to revert back to importing `tippy 0.1.0` since it is the latest available version on CRAN and CRAN pkgs cannot depend on package versions under development.

* created a new toggle on the `Data` tab that allows users to select which CDISC pilot study data sources they wish to use in the app.

* Minor bug improvements

# tidyCDISC 0.0.4 
* cleaning up `devtools::check()` & preparing for CRAN release.

# tidyCDISC 0.0.3

* For `tippy` package, added lower bound on to version `1.0.0` since it includes more user friendly options.

# tidyCDISC 0.0.2

This release (PR #65) performs a lot of functions, testing on many non-pilot ADSL files to ensure app's robustness beyond just the CDISC pilot data:

* closes #64: Agg class objects lost "droppability" when only ADSL uploaded
* gets rid of annoying font awesome message about verifying an icon exists
* updates gt code that was deprecated
* Made sure 'PARAM' exists in the data when trying to label a block
* got rid of unnecessary argument in col_for_list() and col_for_list_expr()
* added some code that helped the FREQ block produce the correct results when ran locally (via a reproducibility script)
* a little code clean up for readability

# tidyCDISC 0.0.1

This release adds meat to the previous skeleton version of `tidyCDISC`. The initial development release was intended to be a "bare bones" platform that could serve as a foundation to build a great clinical data exploratory tool. Version `0.0.1` enriches the user experience by adding useful & commonly needed features for analysis. For more on this release, see [the announcement](https://biogen-inc.github.io/tidyCDISC/articles/Blog.html#announcing-tidycdisc-0-0-1-1) on our blog.
