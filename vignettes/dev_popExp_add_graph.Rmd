Each plot in the Population Explorer is a submodule `mod_popExp_*.R` (where * is the plot name to be added) that is conditionally called within `mod_popExp.R` and `mod_popExp_ui.R`. The plotting module is used for the reactivity logic of the plot; the widgets needed as well as how to render them. The plot function itself is found within `mod_popExp_fct.R`

This tutorial will walk you through adding a plot module and a plot function, then applying it to the Population Explorer module using `mod_popExp_boxplot.R` as an example.

Inside `mod_popExp_boxplot.R` we havew two functions: `boxPlot_ui` which is where we specify the widgets we need to create a boxplot and `boxPlot_srv` which populates the widget dropdown based on the user's data, as well as creates a graph using the `IDEA_boxplot()` function, located in `mod_popExp_fct.R`
