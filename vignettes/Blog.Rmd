# [Announcing `tidyCDISC 0.0.1`](announcing-tidycdisc-0-0-1-1.html)

This release adds meat to the previous skeleton version of `tidyCDISC`. The initial development release was intended to be a "bare bones" platform that could serve as a foundation to build a great clinical data exploratory tool. Version `0.0.1` enriches the user experience by adding useful & commonly needed features for analysis. For more on this release, see our [detailed exploration](https://biogen-inc.github.io/tidyCDISC/articles/announcing-tidycdisc-0-0-1-1.html) of new features in this blog post.
